Spine API
=========

Provides a REST API for Spine.js applications.


Installation
============

In your settings.py:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'spine',
        ...
    )

Then publish the REST API in your urls.py:

    from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url

    urlpatterns = patterns(
        '',
        ...
        url(r'^', include('spine.urls')),
        ...
    )


Usage
=====

To publish an object API write a api.py inside your app.

    from spine.api import SpineAPI
    from .models import Category

    class CategoryAPI(SpineAPI):
        model = Category

This will make available the Category API in `/api/<app_name>/Category` URL.
Where `<app_name>` is the name of the application that contains the Category
model.

By default the API checks the permissions of the authenticated user to access
the model. This can be disabled by setting:

   class CategoryAPI(SpineAPI):
        model = Category
        permission_checking = False

As Django does not has a 'read' permission this is granted if the user has
'change' or 'delete' permission.

I suggest you to read the SpineAPI class in the `spine/api.py` file. It has a
full documentation about its configuration.
